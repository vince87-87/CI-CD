# Experience Continuous Integration with Jenkins | Ansible | Artifactory | SonarQube | PHP

Set Up

This project is partly a continuation of your Ansible work, so simply add and subtract based on the new setup in this project. It will require a lot of servers to simulate all the different environments from dev/ci all the way to production. This will be quite a lot of servers altogether (But you donâ€™t have to create them all at once. Only create servers required for an environment you are working with at the moment. For example, when doing deployments for development, do not create servers for integration, pentest, or production yet).

To minimize the cost of cloud servers, you don not have to create all the servers at once, simply spin up a minimal server set up as you progress through the project implementation and have reached a need for more.

To get started, we will focus on these environments initially.

Ci

Dev

Pentest

Both SIT - For System Integration Testing and UAT - User Acceptance Testing do not require a lot of extra installation or configuration. They are basically the webservers holding our applications. But Pentest - For Penetration testing is where we will conduct security related tests, so some other tools and specific configurations will be needed. In some cases, it will also be used for Performance and Load testing. Otherwise, that can also be a separate environment on its own. It all depends on decisions made by the company and the team running the show.

What we want to achieve, is having Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy for our sites and tools. Each environment setup is represented in the below table and diagrams.

# DNS requirements

Make DNS entries to create a subdomain for each environment. Assuming your main domain is darey.io

You should have a subdomains list like this:

# Ansible Inventory should look like this

ci inventory file



dev Inventory file


pentest inventory file


# Observations:

You will notice that in the pentest inventory file, we have introduced a new concept pentest:children This is because, we want to have a group called pentest which covers Ansible execution against both pentest-todo and pentest-tooling simultaneously. But at the same time, we want the flexibility to run specific Ansible tasks against an individual group.

The db group has a slightly different configuration. It uses a RedHat/Centos Linux distro. Others are based on Ubuntu (in this case user is ubuntu). Therefore, the user required for connectivity and path to python interpreter are different. If all your environment is based on Ubuntu, you may not need this kind of set up. Totally up to you how you want to do this. Whatever works for you is absolutely fine in this scenario.
This makes us to introduce another Ansible concept called group_vars. With group vars, we can declare and set variables for each group of servers created in the inventory file.

For example, If there are variables we need to be common between both pentest-todo and pentest-tooling, rather than setting these variables in many places, we can simply use the group_vars for pentest. Since in the inventory file it has been created as pentest:children Ansible recognizes this and simply applies that variable to both children.

# Ansible Roles for CI Environment

Add two more roles to ansible:

SonarQube 

Artifactory

# Why do we need SonarQube?

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality, it is used to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to 

detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Watch a short description here. There is a lot more hands on work ahead with SonarQube and Jenkins. So, the purpose of 

SonarQube will be clearer to you very soon.

# Why do we need Artifactory?

Artifactory is a product by JFrog that serves as a binary repository manager. The binary repository is a natural extension to the source code repository, in that the outcome of 

your build process is stored. It can be used for certain other automation, but we will it strictly to manage our build artifacts.

Watch a short description here Focus more on the first 10.08 mins

# Configuring Ansible For Jenkins Deployment

In previous projects, you have been launching Ansible commands manually from a CLI. Now, with Jenkins, we will start running Ansible from Jenkins UI.

To do this,

Navigate to Jenkins URL

Install & Open Blue Ocean Jenkins Plugin

Paste the token and connect

Create a new pipeline

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49937302/123442079-1af04080-d607-11eb-9390-e98f94fec594.png)

At this point you may not have a Jenkinsfile in the Ansible repository, so Blue Ocean will attempt to give you some guidance to create one. But we do not need that. We will rather create one ourselves. So, click on Administration to exit the Blue Ocean console.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49937302/123445495-84be1980-d60a-11eb-94a6-e5b6df32b3c2.png)

Here is our newly created pipeline. It takes the name of your GitHub repository.

# Let us create our Jenkinsfile

Inside the Ansible project, create a new directory deploy and start a new file Jenkinsfile inside the directory.

Add the code snippet below to start building the Jenkinsfile gradually. This pipeline currently has just one stage called Build and the only thing we are doing is using the shell script module to echo Building Stage
