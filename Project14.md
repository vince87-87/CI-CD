# Experience Continuous Integration with Jenkins | Ansible | Artifactory | SonarQube | PHP

Set Up

This project is partly a continuation of your Ansible work, so simply add and subtract based on the new setup in this project. It will require a lot of servers to simulate all the different environments from dev/ci all the way to production. This will be quite a lot of servers altogether (But you don’t have to create them all at once. Only create servers required for an environment you are working with at the moment. For example, when doing deployments for development, do not create servers for integration, pentest, or production yet).

Try to utilize your AWS free tier as much as you can, you can also register a new account if you have exhausted the current one. Alternatively, you can use Google Cloud (GCP) to rent virtual machines from this cloud service provider - you can get $300 credit here or here (NOTE: Please read instructions carefully to get your credits)

NOTE: This is still NOT a cloud-focus project yet. AWS cloud end to end project begins from project-15. Therefore, do not worry about advanced AWS or GCP configuration. All we need here is virtual machines that can be accessed over SSH.

To minimize the cost of cloud servers, you don not have to create all the servers at once, simply spin up a minimal server set up as you progress through the project implementation and have reached a need for more.

To get started, we will focus on these environments initially.

Ci
Dev
Pentest
Both SIT - For System Integration Testing and UAT - User Acceptance Testing do not require a lot of extra installation or configuration. They are basically the webservers holding our applications. But Pentest - For Penetration testing is where we will conduct security related tests, so some other tools and specific configurations will be needed. In some cases, it will also be used for Performance and Load testing. Otherwise, that can also be a separate environment on its own. It all depends on decisions made by the company and the team running the show.

What we want to achieve, is having Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy for our sites and tools. Each environment setup is represented in the below table and diagrams.
